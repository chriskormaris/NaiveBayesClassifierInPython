# NaiveBayesClassifier

Made by Chris Kormaris

Programming Language: Python

Unzip the files "TRAIN.zip" and "TEST.zip", in the same directory where the Python files are. First, run the python file "FeatureSelectionUsingIG.py" to generate the output file "feature_dictionary.txt", containing the features tokens that we'll use. Then run "MyCustomNaiveBayesSpamHam.py" to start the classification process.

Note: You can use your own Train and Test text files if you want, as long as they contain "spam" or "ham" in their names, according to their category. The existence of the substrings "spam" or "ham" in a text file defines in which category of the two the text file belongs to.
